Introduced by Edward Tufte in 1983 (book : The Visual Display of Quantitavie). The author distinguish between Data-ink as the non-erasablse ink used to **show the data** in a visualization and the Non-Data-ink all the remainging ink (used for other stuff.. for instance, background, lines etc. to remove/delete as much as possible). `Data-ink Ratio = Data-ink / Ink used to print the visualization`
